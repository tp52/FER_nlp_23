Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

You don't need nobody else, no

Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone

Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers

Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us

Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

You the only father that I ever knew

Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em

Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now

I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (Oh, I), run run away, run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (Well, alright)
Run run away, run run away (Oh, I), run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (Well, alright)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

Damned if I do, shit, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—What she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing, I suppose
[Chorus: J. Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are

I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well

Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday

Goes for all y'all

It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?

Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before

Think being broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt

And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga, feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours

Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake

I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang

Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you

Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline
[Chorus]
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
[Chorus]
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven, seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day (Shit)

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)

- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!

(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Verse 1]
You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 2]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me ""don't say that""?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie
[Hook 3]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
In six inch stilettos
Dr. Dre, Hello, perculatin', keep 'em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin', you gets naythin'
'Cause I never been to Satan for hardcore administratin'
Gangbang affiliatin', MC Ren'll have you
Wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(Get to dialing) 9-1-1 emergency
(And you can tell 'em) It's my son, he's hurtin' me
(And he's a felon) On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers follow the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga, I'm a scholar
The incredible, heterosexual, credible
Beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you, hand picked motherfuckers, givin' up transcripts

You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'

Run trains on gold diggers, beware these fo' niggas
Scarin' motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
Makin 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
Bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time, same channel, don't change the dial

Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
Listening with your arms crossed
Questioning Dre's credibility (What?)
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits
Y'all be killin' me
As if I need to make mo', I got a mansion
And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick! (Hello)
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million-plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker, I'm Dre! I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to, not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch! (Hello)

I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen' than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen', we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
""Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate""

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: ""did I like Arsenio?""
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have

But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

Life is the bitch, and death is her sister

It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
[Outro: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Oh), don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah

'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else

I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help

And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex

Less talk, more head right now, huh

Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""

Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this

So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia

I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you would've thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that, ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty

And you were screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody

He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go into your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute

Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents

Renegade, never been afraid to say

'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got ninety-nine problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed"

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-

'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not

Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back

Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?

But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
You might also like[Refrain: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
[Chorus: Eminem & Joyner Lucas]
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice808Embed"

*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersYou might also like736Embed"

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects

Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box

K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street

I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)

Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

[Chorus (Condensed): Kendrick Lamar, Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement

Need to take care of they three or four kids

Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)

One day, I'm gonna understand

[Verse 1]
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment

And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn

I been havin' trouble sleepin', battlin' these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathin': is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinkin' 'bout the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I'm just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
In God's desire, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wonderin', well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is
[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)
[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain't trippin' on it
Tuesdays I'm hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're stayin' over
Thursdays I'm sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright

Can you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl

You don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me

And never come back again

It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine

You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Damn, you gotta go get somethin' to eat, man
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, man
Ayo, man
Damn, what's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, man, he coming
Ah! (Oh, what the fuck?)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men

Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again

It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers

Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icy
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""

Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned

I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But every time I rap I'm more trapped

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We trying to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot (Sunny Digital)
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Aye, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Lady, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She sucking and we fucking like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy

First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
You might also like[Chorus]
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Intro]
Fuck Jay-Z
What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dawg (You? What?)
Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Fuck Jay-Z
[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

Ayo, pass me the weed (Tsk, there you go)
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man (Ain't no doubt)
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the motherfuckin' ring
[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?
[Interlude]
I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)

Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death

I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)
[Refrain 2]
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back

Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia

It's been a long time comin'

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell124Embed"

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Outro: Nas]
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man [Lake Gucciano?], one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big [Bo?], one love
To [Oogie?], yeah, one love120Embed"

[Intro: Nas]
Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

And my man Preemo from Gang Starr

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

(Nas is like...) Sex to a nympho, but nothin' sweet
I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin' somethin' deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies

(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)

But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Post-Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

[Chorus: Total]
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

[Outro: Puff Daddy & Total]
Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga

The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (Uh)
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with (That's right)
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not? (Uh)
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy (Come on)

Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[Verse: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

[Intro]
It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

[Verse]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, ""Bounce!""
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, ""Hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins

High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like niggas move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rule Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it

Doesn't it seem odd to you?

Hey, open the last seal for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!
[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
For the pump now Leatherface, sin runnin' thuggin' and cuttin'
Little Mo Hart want to pull it ain't nothin'
Bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guns that’s fucked up
Now let me get down for the grind
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get down for the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, ""What's happenin'?""
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, ""When all the ballin' stops?""
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yea, yea, yea

If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player, please

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke — gunsmoke! Gunsmoke!
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
""Hail Mary, full of grace..."" — smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag, and the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money? Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capisce-ah? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
I got so much style, I should be down with the Stylistics
""Make up to break up"", niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jumpin' Around
Jacked her, then I asked her, ""Who's the man?""
She said, ""B-I-G"", then I bust in her E-Y-E

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blunt like mustard
Trust it! My hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh!
Leave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies — no ifs, ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon got the little hookers screamin' (Woo!)
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

There's several different levels to Devil worshipin'

Animals, havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket — I'm lyin', I got a .9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours
Yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth!
I'm dead wrong!

[Verse 1]
My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', ""It's so hard""
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over bein' resistant
'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip

Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers know the pedi'
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get delgnarts for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?

Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?

Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
You might also like[Chorus: Talent]
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
[Verse 2: 2Pac & Talent]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is
[Chorus: Talent]
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Talent]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
[Chorus: Talent & 2Pac]
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
[Verse 1: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up

[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty
Uh, feel me!
(Come with me; Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
Much too hardened for a smile, way too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Bail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks

To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty

You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam

But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me

It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it

But they can't do nothin' to a G
[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where those cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggas and low riders in ski masks
Screamin', ""Thug Life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me

Hey, to my nigga 'Pac

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' every day, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now

You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this

A toast to the gangsters

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bombin' hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit

You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Now, follow as we ride!
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside!
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?

Release me to the streets, and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me

There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid

So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots

Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Verse 1]
As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

[Verse 2]
Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!
[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

[Verse 3]
Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

[Verse 2]
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh

You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy

Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright

I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

[Verse]
Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh

Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, ""Mother never weep,"" my brother finds blood
I say, ""Shut up ’fore she sees,"" another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, ""Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters""
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
Better luck next time

Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind

Go make that money, money, money

And get that money, money, money

You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 2: Usher]
When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari
And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions

I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)

I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, ""One second, baby, please hear me""

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

Nobody wants to be alone

Then maybe...

When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house

But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling

If you on that bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag and my flag red
I'm outta my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom, I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch

Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)

Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)

Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (Ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (Ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (Ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
Now I know I can break you off, come and let me break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost
I was gonna put you on, I was gonna put you on
I was gonna change your life, girl, but I don't wanna break your heart

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, ""Keep it drama free""
Woah-woah
(Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Yeah, yeah, told you that I'm leaving, deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timin' is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind again, again
And deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off, they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout, “You know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout
[Verse 5: Fabolous, Chris Brown & Fabolous, Drake]
Accordin' to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some old ish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna give the middle finger, but I got two better
So you gon' diss me even though you know it's wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I'm gone
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out

[Verse 6: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hunnids, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini half my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their heads down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I'm talkin' ballers slang
R-O-Z-A-Y on the wall in that Hall of Fame (Maybach Music, Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
[Verse 7: André 3000]
The farewell email (Yeah) from a female (Yeah)
But I'm a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details (Ahem)
What it entails is hard to say like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she's not a bore
But neither a whore, who needs to know more
The kind you can't ignore, but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all that she came for
But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It's hard to throw up the deuces
'Cause when you know it's juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses 'til the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye
Say bye-bye
Say bye-bye to her (Deuces)

Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy

I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop

You just wasted my time

[Verse 1]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed

Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target

Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!

Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know, I know, I don't really care about her being pregnant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do?
We should go get her album when it come out
There she go, there she go, there she—
Hi Missy
Hi Missy?

It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs

Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie, oogie-oggie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now, baby, give a booty naked, take off all your clothes
And light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her, ""Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire""
I tell her, ""Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball""

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, ""I saw, I conquered, I came"" (Ha-ha)
They say the chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin’ he runnin’ the game
Now big bang boogie, get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said “Walk this way”

Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)
[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? Oh

Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Alright, close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty assy
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines

Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
